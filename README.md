## Installation

You will need Node.js 18+ on your local development machine.

```bash
npm install jigsawstack
# or
yarn add jigsawstack
```

## Setup
First, get your API key from the [JigsawStack Dashboard](https://jigsawstack.com/dashboard)

Then, initialize the SDK:
```ts
import { JigsawStack } from "jigsawstack";

const jigsaw = JigsawStack({ apiKey: "your-api-key" });
```

## Usage

AI Scraping Example:
```ts
const resp = await jigsaw.web.ai_scrape({
    url: "https://www.amazon.com/Cadbury-Mini-Caramel-Eggs-Bulk/dp/B0CWM99G5W",
    element_prompts: ["prices"],
});
```

Text to Speech Example:
```ts
const resp = await jigsaw.audio.text_to_speech({
    text: "Hello, how are you doing?",
});
```

Upload a file to use across any API example:
```ts
const file = /*reference to file blob or buffer*/

await jigsaw.store.upload(file,{
    filename: "receipt.png",
});

// Now you can use the file_key in any API call
const ocrResp = await jigsaw.vision.vocr({
    file_store_key: "receipt.png",
});

const objectDetectionResp = await jigsaw.vision.object_detection({
    file_store_key: "receipt.png",
});
```
